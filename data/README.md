# Dataset: Virginia Respiratory Surveillance (Sample Public Health Dataset)

This folder contains a synthetic but realistic public health surveillance dataset modeled after county-level trends in **Virginia (VA)**. The data represents a 12-month respiratory illness monitoring period with vaccination coverage by county.

The goal of this dataset is to demonstrate real-world public health analytics skills across:
- Data cleaning (Excel / Python ETL)
- Trend analysis (SQL)
- Cohort analysis (vaccination vs burden)
- Dashboard visualization (Excel / BI tools)

## ‚úÖ Why Virginia?

Virginia is a **realistic statewide model** because:
- It includes *independent cities* (treated like counties), which improves realism
- You live in the DMV region ‚Üí authenticity boost for recruiters
- Public health hiring managers favor localized datasets over generic Kaggle CSVs

This dataset gives credibility to the entire portfolio by providing a realistic scenario that simulates work done by public health analysts in government or healthcare settings.
